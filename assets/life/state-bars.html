    <h1>
      State Bars; a productivity app to manage your life better
    </h1>

    <p>
      This week I&apos;ve created
      <a href="https://hamidb80.github.io/state-bars/">
        an app
      </a>
      ðŸ’¡
      based on these articles by Oliver Emberton:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://oliveremberton.com/2014/life-is-a-game-this-is-your-strategy-guide/">
          Life is a game. This is your strategy guide
        </a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://oliveremberton.com/2013/how-to-master-your-life/">
          How to master your life
        </a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://oliveremberton.com/2013/how-to-master-your-time/">
          How to master your time
        </a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The main motivation for this app was that
      habit tracking apps, have these problems:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>
          day-based;
        </b>
        if you miss a day for work/life situations,
        you cannot compensate
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>
          they are 0 or 1;
        </b>
        <em>
          i.e. miss it or do it.
        </em>
        you cannot do something more than once or
        do fraction of it.

        Imagine you wanna do 100 push-ups a day
        <span footnote>
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_D2lIUuQHA">
            I did 100 pushups every day for a YEAR
          </a>
        </span>
        ;
        you do 100 on first day but second you only do
        60. Should you check that or not?
