      Really amazing article, it remarks that 
      <em> why success is a mindset </em> 
      and tells a real story about <em>Tom Toro</em> who
      currently draws and writes regularly for The New Yorker and a number of other publications.
    </p>
    <p dir="auto">
      Tom sent drawings every day to publications and after 609 days (609 rejections),
      finally his drawing was accepted.
    </p>

    <p dir="auto">
      below I've collected some quotes:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      As the failures piled up, you’d start asking yourself,
      “Should I be doing this at all?”
      And you’d likely decide—emphatically—”no” and move onto the backup plan (if you had one).
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      He kept going because he knew something about failure that many never realize:
      <b>
        he only had to get one yes to erase all the noes 
      </b>
      and getting that yes was completely within his control if he carefully analyzed each failure.
      <mark>Tom knew that success was a mindset</mark>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      He realized success was <mark>exponential</mark>. 
      Tom knew once he had his first break, 
      more would follow. 
      Getting accepted once in 610 tries <b>does not mean that ratio will continue</b>. 
      Each success shortens the time between it and the next.
    </blockquote>
