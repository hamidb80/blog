    <h1>
      Oh I feel so much better!
    </h1>

    <p dir="auto">
      I remember as a teenager the only thing I did continously the most was programming.
      As I started programming my inner voice would go silence,
      I didn't worry about the future anymore; 
      that's why I'm really good at it 😐
    </p>

    <p dir="auto">
      But for anything else (it includes studying, eating, sleeping, ...),
      while I doing it,
      someone or something always would song these on my ears:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>
          what would you do tomorrow?
        </li>
        <li>
          maybe a bad thing will happen?
        </li>
        <li>
          what about university?
        </li>
        <li>
          do you want to marry?
        </li>
        <li>
          what if you don't get good grade in the next exam?
        </li>
        <li>
          what if ...
        </li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>

      And this shit goes on ..., it goes on as it paralyzes me.
      I remember a lot of my life situations this voice in my head.
    </p>

    <p dir="auto">
      But today I made a difference, I was studying for a exam in
      next 5 months and I said this for every page I would turn.
      [In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful]. <span footnote>
        I said it in Arabic, which is
        <bdo dir="rtl">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِیمِ</bdo>
      </span>
      and after couple of minutes, I've noticed that I don't hear
      the shitty noise in my head as mentioned above, Wow!
    </p>

    <p dir="auto">
      Immediately thought of this:
    </p>

    <p dir="auto">
      And these
      Ayat<span footnote>
        Ayat is plural of Ayah or <bdo dir="rtl">آیه</bdo> in Arabic, means "sign"
      </span>
      from Quran:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Say, "I seek refuge in the Lord of humankind,
        </li>

          the Master of humankind,

        <li>
          <b>
            from among jinn <span footnote> some kind of creatures </span> and humankind."
