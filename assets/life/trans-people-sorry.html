      Trans People, Sorry you've been tricked...üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà
    </h1>

      I know, I know, it both touchy and controversal to talk about
      "<em>Trans people</em>"
      <span footnote>
        people who have changed their sexuality
      </span>
      but I think it's <b>a lot better to punch in the face by truth,
        rather than having sweet dreams</b>(which is lie).
    </p>

    <hr />

    <p dir="auto">
      Before the trans agenda began, a dream of a kid, a teenager or
      any young person was <b>to be someone important</b>, someone who had dreams;
      I mean real dreams like becoming a pilot, an engineer,
      someone who changes the world <i>for good</i>.
    </p>

    <p dir="auto">
      But guess what? Nowadays their dreams have become to be
      <em><mark>another gender</mark></em>
      <span footnote><b>seriously??</b> Is that your <em>DREAM</em>???</span> ,
      and the rest of his/her/them? life fight for his/her/them?? rights,
      while dealing with issues of transitioning. <span footnote>for example the drugs, medications, political rights,
        ... </span>
    </p>

    <p dir="auto">
      Honestly, what's wrong with your gender? I know being man or being woman
      has trade-offs, but you have to accept something in your life.
      Accept and grow. Deal with your own problems and come up with solutions.
    </p>

    <p dir="auto">
      It seems funny that a lot of people who wanna be another gender
      want to be in peace with themselves.

      Why not accept who you are and be in peace with your self?
      It's a lot cheaper!
    </p>

    <p dir="auto">
      You know, the Evil wants you
      to not look further what a human would look like?
      to not grow your inner peace. How can you become aware of the world and
      what politicians do, <b>when you are busy <em>with yourself?</em></b>
    </p>

    <p dir="auto">
      Hey! I've been lied to you too!
      You may have seen lots of people that are not Trans but are not
      in peace with their selves either. You know why?
